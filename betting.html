    <h3>THE RULES: </h3>
    <p id="rules">
      I'd like to begin the instructions by first pointing out that this game has absolutely nothing to do with "YOLO", "Swag" or Beiber. That being said these three concepts are imperative for your success as a player. So I guess you're wondering then, wtf is this game about? As Charlie Sheen would say the answer is simple, winning. The rules are simple: Place a bet($5 or $10), take a guess (1-10) and make some cash. Now get down to business!
